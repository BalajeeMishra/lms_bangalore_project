                This training course is beyond my expectations. These tools and methodology & principals have opened my eyes on how to be effective and ethical! Honestly saying I wanted to be a Researcher but, due to lack of knowledge and guidance it
                was difficult for me (I was thinking) but, after attending the course I really at least found my path that how I have to start. Thanks Sambodhi and their amazing teacher/ trainer(s). Looking forward to putting all those learning
                things in my professional and personal practices. Thanks again.

                MEL4DP Program has immensely helped me in getting a clarity on MEL through a clear practical lens. The course taught me various aspects of MEL practice and theory and dashboard making by drawing examples from different case studies. I
                strongly recommend this course to the beginner and mid-level professionals interested in monitoring and evaluation. A big thank you to Sambodhi and my mentors for providing me a scholarship to pursue this course.

                I have been a development practitioner since last six years. Working at the grassroots in Pradan developed a sense of understanding of real challenges and opportunities to work with the rural communities. I however felt the need to
                understand the "change" that's coming by the immense work we all were doing. I switched my career to M&E in sambodhi. We were offered a course that was so deep yet easy to understand the gist, was a bliss to a professional like me
                from the field. Right from history of monitoring and evaluation to all the techniques and technicalities, this course is a complete package for any professional wanting to get in the domain of M&E. This course also offers some
                learning while doing which is great and easy to cope with regular office work.
